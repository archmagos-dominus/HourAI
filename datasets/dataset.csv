Alice,"Hey, hey, listen!"
Alice,I decided!
Alice,You're Hourai!
Alice,Hourai!
Hourai,I'm Hourai
Hourai,I-I'm Hourai
Hourai,I am Hourai.
Alice,Ok
Alice,Great weather outside
Alice,Good.
Alice,Well then...
Alice,Shall we start cleaning?
Alice,"Yes, yes, hurry."
Alice,The earlier we start the earlier we'll finish.
Hourai,Huh?
Hourai,That person...
Hourai,I've seen her before...
Hourai,And also...
Alice,"Oh, get the buckets ready."
Alice,Give it you best~
Hourai,Why?
Alice,Hmm?
Alice,Is someone there?
Alice,Could it be Marisa?
Marisa,ALICE!!
Marisa,Are you in?
Alice,I knew it.
Hourai,?
Hourai,Who came?
Alice,"Jeez, I can hear you, no need to scream so loud."
Marisa,Hahaha
Marisa,"Sorry, sorry."
Marisa,Look on my morning walk I found some mushrooms.
Marisa,And I was thinking you could cook a lil' Something with them.
Alice,"Ok, then I'll leave cleaning the garden to you."
Marisa,Huh?
Alice,That way you'll be hungrier; two birds one stone~
Alice,Right?
Marisa,So she says...
Marisa,If I knew this would happen I wouldn't have come 
Alice,HEY!
Alice,Quit slacking!
Marisa,Yeah yeah
Marisa,Alice has it good leaving it to the dolls while I-
Marisa,OW!
Marisa,Auu~
Alice,"Marisa, what's wrong?"
Marisa,This thing fell on me.
Alice,Ah...
Alice,Hourai was it you?
Alice,"That's no good, gotta be more careful."
Alice,"Geez, it's dangerous, got it?"
Marisa,"Umm Alice, aren't you the one moving it?"
Alice,Ah... Well sometimes I don't even know what I'm doing.
Hourai,...
Alice,"Either way, this pain is because of you!"
Alice,Come in. I'll treat your wound.
Marisa,Ah~ It hurts.
Marisa,I'm gonna die!
Alice,Die!?
Hourai,That nostalgic person is Alice... 
Hourai,That thing that came is named Marisa?
Hourai,I don't like her!
Hourai,...
Hourai,I am the only one...
Hourai,Who's supposed to be by her side...
Alice,"There, all better!"
Alice,I'll take care of what's left so you take a rest.
Marisa,Thanks Alice~
Marisa,I was surprised to see you mess up while controlling the dolls.
Alice,Sorry about that.
Alice,"Well, you get to rest because of it."
Alice,And later I'll treat you to lunch too.
Alice,So isn't it great for you?
Marisa,One mustn't let the injured work right?
Alice,"Anyways, I'm going to finish the rest of the cleaning."
Alice,Take care!
Alice,Stay put ok?
Alice,What should I make for lunch?
Marisa,Hehe
Marisa,As if I could stay put!
Marisa, I'll get bored!
Marisa,I'll read some of her books and study~
Marisa,I'm sure it's straight up the second floor.
Marisa,Hm?
Marisa,If it isn't Hourai?
Marisa,Come to apologize for what you did earlier?
Marisa,Guess not...
Marisa,I see...
Marisa,"If it's like that, then, I'll make you show me your secret library!"
Marisa,And all of your willpower!
Alice,Hmm~
Alice,Almost finished.
Alice,Thanks everyone.
Alice,I guess it's time...
Alice,To get started on lunch.
Alice,I'm sure she's hungry by now.
Marisa,She~
Marisa,She's so strong!
Marisa,What the-
Marisa,She's hella strong!!
Marisa,Wait!
Marisa,I got it.
Marisa,I won't go up to the second floor...
Marisa,Listen to me!!
Marisa,Wah!
Marisa,Wah?
Marisa,Huh?
Marisa,What?
Marisa,Why'd she suddenly-
Alice,HEY!
Alice,Didn't I tell you to stay put?
Marisa,"I'm sorry Alice, I won't go up..."
Alice,Huh? You gone crazy from hunger?
Alice,Fine.
Alice,"I'll hurry up and make lunch, so this time be sure to stay put okay?"
Marisa,Eh...
Marisa,Umm...
Marisa,Yeah....
Marisa,Did that not reach Alice?
Hourai,Damn it!
Hourai,A bit longer.
Hourai,"Just a bit more, and I would have given her the finishing blow."
Hourai,Why did Alice have to come in?
Hourai,And what does Alice see in her?
Hourai,"She's loud, weak and dumb!"
Marisa,Well sorry about that!!
Hourai,WAAH!?!
Hourai,"You, since when have you been there?"
Marisa,Since just now...
Hourai,Let me go!
Hourai,Let go!
Marisa,"Wow, she's really moving by herself."
Hourai,What do you intend to do to me?
Marisa,And it looks like Alice doesn't know.
Marisa,There~
Hourai,You!
Hourai,What is this?
Marisa,Let's talk a bit.
Marisa,Sorry about before.
Hourai,The heck you talking about?
Marisa,"First of all, I'm not 'you', I'm Marisa."
Hourai,...
Marisa,"Also, haven't we seen each other lots of times?"
Marisa,Why did you come rushing at me today?
Hourai,I recently became conscious.
Hourai,Since this morning actually...
Hourai,So I don't know who you are.
Hourai,Nor who exactly Alice is.
Marisa,I see...
Marisa,Just recently.
Hourai,But!
Hourai,I know I love Alice.
Hourai,And I know I hate you!
Marisa,Looks like you don't know the situation you're in!
Hourai,Gyaaa!
Hourai,Stop!
Hourai,Stop it!
Marisa,Fuhuhu~
Marisa,Give up?
Marisa,"Anyways, for now I don't wanna cause Alice harm nor fight with you."
Marisa,Got that?
Hourai,Go...
Hourai,Go to hell!
Marisa,Waa!
Hourai,Only I should be by Alice's side!!
Hourai,You nuisance!
Marisa,I can't back down!
Marisa,Now that we are name calling!
Marisa,Let's go for round two!
Alice,Yup.
Alice,This is good!
Alice,With this Marisa will also say it's good right Shanghai?
Alice,Shanghai~
Alice,"Ok, now for the second dish!"
Alice,Shanghai!
Marisa,pant pant
Marisa,Impossible!
Marisa,There's no way!
Marisa,Impossible!
Marisa,I can't beat her without hakkero!!!
Marisa,"But, there no time to be saying that!"
Marisa,Magical physical attack!
Marisa,Here it goes!
Hourai,Quit bullshitting!
Marisa,Unhurt?
Hourai,Of course!
Marisa,"If you can still talk like that after getting hit with that, then how about Giga Marisa Break!"
Marisa,Sorry!
Hourai,Why?
Hourai,Why are Alice and her...
Hourai,Time for you to give in...
Hourai,Be a good girl and let yourself be skewered.
Marisa,A weapon.
Marisa,I need a weapon!
Hourai,This is the end!
Marisa,Waawawawa!
Alice,Marisa!!
Alice,Didn't I tell you to stay put?
Alice,And what are you doing in my room...
Marisa,Alice I'm so glad!
Marisa,You're a life saver!
Marisa,No wait!
Marisa,You're definitely misunderstanding something here!
Alice,Wha...
Alice,Tho... those are my underwear
Marisa,Oh yeah!
Marisa,Hourai!
Marisa,She attacked me!
Alice,Hourai?
Marisa,She came to kill me out of the blue
Marisa,And I had to resist so I got your drawer 
Alice,Marisa...
Alice,The dolls can't move without me...
Marisa,It's true I tell ya!
Marisa,Hourai... she... she...
Marisa,I'm innocent!
Hourai,So?
Hourai,How did it go?
Marisa,Somehow she calmed down...
Hourai,With what excuse?
Marisa,She forgave me after telling her I had an interest in her underwear.
Hourai,Idiot.
Marisa,Shut it!
Marisa,So what?
Marisa,You're not gonna come at me again?
Hourai,It'll just bother Alice again so no.
Marisa,Hahaha
Marisa,Well yeah...
Marisa,And what are you gonna do?
Marisa,Tell Alice that you can move by yourself?
Hourai,I don't want to do that...
Marisa,Hm?
Hourai,"If telling her makes her change somehow, I'd rather not."
Marisa,"I see, you already thought about it"
Marisa,But you know
Marisa,If you were as cute as Shanghai she wouldn't mind.
Hourai,Shanghai?
Marisa,One of the dolls Alice uses.
Marisa,Speak of the devil.
Marisa,A note from Alice?
Marisa,Thanks Shanghai!
Shanghai,Shanghai~
Marisa,"Hourai, this is Shanghai."
Marisa,Ain't she cute?
Marisa,Hourai?
Hourai,Hmm.
Hourai,I hate her...
Shanghai,Shanghai~
Marisa,Oh-
Marisa,"You're lively today too, eh, Shanghai?"
Alice,You're late.
Alice,We've already finished with preparations.
Marisa,"Ah, sorry I couldn't help with that."
Alice,Don't worry.
Alice,"Anyways, let's hurry and start now."
Marisa,Hey~ sorry for the wait!
Patchouli,I don't really mind
Patchouli,Time passes by quickly when I'm reading.
Patchouli,"Other than that, return the books you stole."
Marisa,"I will, okay?"
Marisa,But I'll be borrowing them until I die!
Alice,It's useless Patchouli.
Alice,She's a lump of twisted logic after all.
Patchouli,So it seems...
Patchouli,"Well, I'll make you return them before that happens."
Patchouli,By force!
Marisa,Hey hey that's quite a scary face there!
Marisa,It will ruin your pretty face you know?
Marisa,What?
Alice,shocked
Patchouli,flustered
Alice,Then let's get to the main topic.
Alice,Today's topic is to understand the capacity limit of one's magical power.
Alice,"For us, magic users, it is very important."
Alice,I believe we should make it our item of research.
Patchouli,I see...
Alice,I believe each magician possesses their own unique capacity limit of magical power.
Alice,"Currently, I am thinking that it is impossible to increase one's magic capacity limit."
Alice,"I can make a few estimates, but we still haven't attained such a status so it would be hard to give it shape."
Alice,"But if we think about what we just said and go from there, there would be a huge difference, wouldn't you think?"
Alice,What do you think Marisa?
Patchouli,What do you think Marisa?
Marisa,Eh!?
Marisa,"Ah... aaa.... Well, I can also use magic but I'm just a normal human so I still don't know about the limits of magical powers and stuff like that..."
Patchouli,Haa~ 
Patchouli,I knew it would be like that.
Alice,"Well, let's talk among ourselves today too."
Marisa,"... I've been thinking, am I even needed for there gatherings?"
Alice,"At times, the opinion of other species can be very useful"
Marisa,Ah... sorry for not meeting expectations.
Patchouli,We weren't expecting anything.
Marisa,Ah... I see.
Marisa,"Hey, it's Marisa, I'm coming in."
Marisa,"Oh, you sure are well behaved today!"
Hourai,"And , as always, you sure are making a face that pisses me off."
Marisa,Right back at ya!
Hourai,"Well, what are you here for?"
Hourai,Weren't you guys having a gathering today?
Marisa,"It's always like this. I can't understand a thing they're saying, my head's gonna explode."
Hourai,Idiots sure have it hard.
Marisa,Shut up!
Marisa,Well that doesn't matter.
Marisa,I got a good plan for you today.
Hourai,A plan?
Marisa,Take a look at this!
Hourai,What's this?
Hourai,It looks like one of the boxes Alice has...
Marisa,Oh you noticed that?
Marisa,This is a sewing kit.
Hourai,"Ah, that box with lots of things to sew with."
Hourai,Well? What about it?
Marisa,"You see, I heard a little something."
Alice,Hmm...
Patchouli,"Alice, what's wrong?"
Alice,Hm?
Alice,I was thinking it's time for a change of clothes.
Patchouli,Huh? You gone crazy from hunger?
Patchouli,You're switching to your summer clothes already?
Alice,Not that.
Alice,This child's clothes are a bit worn out...
Marisa,So you see...
Hourai,I can guess what you're going to say.
Marisa,And that doll's name is...
Marisa,Shanghai!
Hourai,HELL NO!!
Marisa,That was fast!
Hourai,Why do I have to make clothes for her?
Marisa,You don't seem to get it.
Marisa,"To be honest, Shanghai is the doll that Alice seems to like best."
Marisa,"And so, by giving her those clothes as a present, Alice will be really happy."
Marisa,"Then you could get close to Alice not as Hourai, but as an individual."
Hourai,Individual?
Marisa,"Yeah, as long as your cover isn't blown you can be that someone who gave her a nice present."
Hourai,An individual?
Patchouli,"Marisa, Alice asked if you're going to have dinner here."
Patchouli,What... are you doing?
Marisa,No!
Marisa,I thought she was well made so I let myself to examine her!
Marisa,I'll put her back right away!
Patchouli,Hmm...
Patchouli,She certainly is well made...
Marisa,Ri... right?
Marisa,"Anyways, dinner!"
Marisa,What are you gonna do Patchouli?
Patchouli,Marisa.
Patchouli,Are you looking down on me?
Patchouli,This doll clearly has a magical power the other dolls do not.
Patchouli,Will you tell me the details?
Marisa,O- okay?
Alice,They're not coming down...
Patchouli,I see.
Patchouli,"So in short, you know almost nothing."
Marisa,Don't be so blunt...
Patchouli,"Well, isn't that how it is?"
Patchouli,"However, this is quite strange."
Patchouli,Is it a type of artifact spirit?
Patchouli,"I heard Hourai was made before Shanghai, so it wouldn't be so strange for Hourai to turn into an Artifact spirit."
Patchouli,"You don't have any clue yourself, right?"
Hourai,"Yeah, not a thing."
Patchouli,"Not so amiable, is she?"
Marisa,I think so too.
Patchouli,"For the time being, I'll keep this a secret from Alice, so do come help on my research sometime."
Patchouli,you won't get to see an automated doll that often after all.
Marisa,What kind of research?
Patchouli,"Well, doing things like this then things like that and finally many many other things."
Marisa,Hey...
Patchouli,I'm lying.
Marisa,"Oh yeah Patchouli, I have another favour to ask."
Patchouli,Yes?
Marisa,Teach her how to sew!
Hourai,Wh... What?
Hourai,I didn't say I was going to...
Patchouli,"I'm not that knowledgeable on the subject, but if you're fine with me, I can do it."
Patchouli,But I'll be examining you while at it.
Marisa,thank you!
Marisa,Ain't that great Hourai?
Hourai,...
Marisa,"By the way, what are you going to do about dinner?"
Patchouli,I'll eat here of course!
Marisa,"I see, then I too shall accept Alice's invitation."
Koakuma,Welcome back Lady Patchouli.
Patchouli,"I'm back, Koa."
Hourai,"Hey Marisa, why do I have to do it here?"
Marisa,"Well, there'll be a lot of inconvenience at Alice's house, right?"
Marisa,"Plus, the plan will go poof if you're found out."
Marisa,"Also, there's only books here so you'll be able to concentrate."
Patchouli,Sorry about that.
Patchouli,"Well then, it'll be odd if Hourai isn't at Alice's house right?"
Patchouli,"Hourai, come here for a bit."
Hourai,Hm?
Hourai,WOAAAAAH!?
Patchouli,Oh...
Marisa,Eh!?
Marisa,A surprised reaction?
Patchouli,Hm?
Patchouli,"Ah, it's ok, don't worry."
Patchouli,Look.
Marisa,Two Hourais?
Patchouli,This is a soulless dummy.
Patchouli,"The quality is about the same, but the problem is it'd be only a matter of time before a doll user of Alice's level figures it out."
Patchouli,About one week.
Patchouli,You have to finish it before then.
Marisa,O- okay!
Marisa,Then I'll leave Hourai in your hands Patchouli.
Patchouli,"Marisa, I have something to ask of you."
Marisa,What is it?
Patchouli,"It's fine even if it's just during Alice's sleeping time, but could you bring Shanghai here?"
Patchouli,There's the matter of measuring for her clothes.
Patchouli,"But, more importantly, if there's a possibility where she gains consciousness like Hourai, we may be able to understand the cause."
Marisa,That sure is a difficult favour.
Marisa,"I got it, but make sure to teach Hourai thoroughly."
Hourai,Marisa.
Marisa,Hm? Forgot something?
Hourai,Why do you concern yourself over me?
Hourai,Will you gain something from it?
Marisa,"Haha, listen Hourai."
Marisa,"In this closed up Gensokyo, you have to enjoy every single thing or you'll miss out."
Marisa,That's all there is to it.
Hourai,Argh!
Hourai,This is pissing me off!
Hourai,Stupid sewing!
Patchouli,"That thing that pisses you off, it's something your master does everyday, you know?"
Patchouli,"Of course, for the sake of you guys, her dolls."
Hourai,Ugu...
Patchouli,"This may not be appropriate coming from me, but..."
Patchouli,Where there's a will there's a way... you see.
Hourai,Easier said than done...
Marisa,Hey Patchouli!
Koakuma,Be quiet in the library!
Patchouli,"Marisa, that was surprisingly fast."
Marisa,give me a reward for working so hard.
Patchouli,"Very well, good work."
Patchouli,"So, where's Shanghai?"
Marisa,"Ah, well, you see..."
Patchouli,"What, did you fail?"
Marisa,"No, I properly led her here but..."
Patchouli,Hm?
Patchouli,Led her?
Marisa,Um... Shanghai...
Shanghai,"This would be the first time we exchange words, would it not?"
Shanghai,Allow me to introduce myself once again.
Shanghai,"I am one of the dolls who serve Alice Margatroid, Shanghai."
Shanghai,It's nice to meet you Patchouli Knowledge and Elder Sister!
Hourai,'Elder Sister?
Shanghai,"You see, you were born earlier than I was, thus you're my older sister!"
Hourai,Somehow this is really pissing me off... what should I do?
Marisa,Calm down.
Marisa,She's probably one step ahead of you in the way of words.
Patchouli,"Marisa, it's best for you to stay over."
Patchouli,We'll have to return her to Alice before she wakes up after all.
Shanghai,Ah... do not worry.
Shanghai,"I can return by myself, and it would be bothersome for Marisa to come over everyday, would it not?"
Marisa,Oh what a well raised doll.
Hourai,I don't trust her.
Hourai,We don't know what's hidden behind that smile of hers.
Marisa,"Well, you do show everything on your face, huh?"
Hourai,Shut up!
Marisa,Ow!
Patchouli,I wonder if Alice has realized anything by now...
Shanghai,"No, I think we still can make it somehow."
Patchouli,How so?
Shanghai,"While she does feel that something is a little bit off, it appears to me the she has yet to notice that elder sister has been replaced."
Patchouli,That's odd...
Patchouli,I would think Alice has begun to realize it by now...
Patchouli,...
Patchouli,Shanghai.
Patchouli,You're doing something aren't you?
Shanghai,That's a bit exaggerated.
Shanghai,I'm making It so Alice won't think too much of the dummy...
Shanghai,I simply though it would be odd for me not to do anything while my sister tried so hard to make clothes for me.
Patchouli,"You know that Hourai is making clothes not for you, but to make Alice happy, right?"
Shanghai,"That's fine, if Alice is happy, then I, too, would be very happy."
Shanghai,"Besides, I also love seeing my sister as she tries her very best!"
Patchouli,"Having such a good little sister like you, it must be hard for the older sister..."
Shanghai,Is that so?
Patchouli,Quite.
Patchouli,I'll go talk to your sister for a bit.
Patchouli,"Hourai, how is it going?"
Patchouli,"What, you don't have to glare at me like that."
Hourai,I'm not glaring.
Hourai,I just don't want you to see.
Patchouli,Why?
Hourai,Because it doesn't look like I'll be able to finish in time...
Patchouli,So it seems.
Hourai,"Also, I look stupid being so desperate about it."
Hourai,Not being able to finish it even when I'm trying so hard... so uncool.
Patchouli,Just like her.
Hourai,Eh!?
Patchouli,You're just like Marisa.
Hourai,Wha-!!?
Hourai,Why am I?
Hourai,Don't put me together with her!
Patchouli,"You know, since a long time ago, she had a very good friend."
Patchouli,"But that friend of hers is incredibly powerful, she can do anything without putting too much effort."
Patchouli,"Marisa has always been upset by this fact, that's why she always tries her hardest."
Patchouli,"Day by day, day in, day out."
Patchouli,It seemed she always tried her hardest.
Patchouli,But she doesn't want anyone to know how hard she works.
Patchouli,Why do you think that is?
Hourai,Dunno...
Patchouli,For the same reason as you.
Patchouli,"Because it will make you looks bad when you fail after trying so hard, right?"
Hourai,Ah...
Hourai,Yeah ...
Patchouli,"So, if you don't want to be put together with her, work hard,try your best and make sure to finish what you're doing."
Hourai,I understand.
Hourai,"Hey Patchouli, can I ask something?"
Patchouli,What is it?
Hourai,Do you hate Marisa?
Patchouli,Hmm...
Patchouli,"If I were to choose, I'd say that.... I really hate her."
Hourai,Ahh...
Marisa,Hey Hourai!
Marisa,Have you finished the present?
Koakuma,Miss Marisa!
Koakuma,Be quiet in the library!
Marisa,"Oh oops, sorry about that."
Marisa,Where's Hourai by the way?
Marisa,Hm?
Marisa,"Oh, she's sleeping"
Patchouli,There's no way a doll can sleep right?
Marisa,Well... you could say she's sleeping.
Patchouli,It seems she ran out of magical power by being far from Alice for such a long time.
Patchouli,She's now replenishing herself.
Marisa,Hmm...
Marisa,"So she's not completely automated after all, huh?"
Patchouli,"We don't have definite proof, but it seems that the fact she gained consciousness is related to Alice."
Patchouli,"By the way, about the present..."
Patchouli,She's finished it perfectly.
Marisa,Now what do we have here.
Patchouli,Work hard and you get results.
Marisa,"Oh, what's this, sarcasm?"
Patchouli,Of course not.
Patchouli,"I'll leave the rest to you,"
Patchouli,Be sure to properly give it to her.
Marisa,"Yeah, leave it to me."
Alice,"Oh, snow."
Alice,Very odd for this season.
Shanghai,Shanghai!
Alice,Oh?
Alice,Marisa came to visit?
Marisa,"Hourai, I wonder what you are."
Marisa,Yo~ Alice!
Alice,What?
Alice,Have you come here bringing troublesome things again?
Marisa,Don't say such cruel things.
Marisa,"Look, I came to hand over a present."
Marisa,A self moving doll with human emotions.
Alice,Eh~ for me?
Marisa,"Yeah, something you'll like is in it."
Alice,You don't have any courtesy do you?
Marisa,I'm very interested.... But...
Marisa,"Come on, you can open the present, it was inspired by watching your puppet show apparently."
Alice,Watching my puppet show?
Marisa,I should just leave it be for now.
Alice,Uwaaah!
Alice,Is this... hand made?
Marisa,"After all, you have worked so hard."
Alice,"Seems like Shanghai has took a linking to it, she looks like she wants to wear it."
Alice,Who made this?
Marisa,It's from an anonymous person.
Alice,I see.
Alice,Then can you tell that person something for me?
Marisa,Anything.
Alice,Come visit me someday and let's be friends!
Marisa,"Okay, leave it to me."
Marisa,I'm sure she'll be really happy...
Patchouli,Oh?
Marisa,That she'll come here flying.
Shanghai,BIG-SIIIS!!
Shanghai,SIS-
Shanghai,SI-
Shanghai,Why are you avoiding me?
Hourai,Why the heck are you trying to hug me?
Shanghai,"It's just kinship, Sis!"
Shanghai,Come!
Shanghai,Let us be more intimate sisters!
Hourai,HELL NO!!!
Shanghai,Why?
Hourai,Aside from not feeling like we're actually sisters.
Hourai,I don't like how you're so clingy!
Shanghai,Then...
Shanghai,Then what should I do so you would like me?
Hourai,'What'? Eh...
Hourai,That depends on your body!
Shanghai,My... body...?
Marisa,"One day, there was a doll who started moving without Alice's intent."
Marisa,"Her name is Hourai, a dangerous doll that's extremely aggressive and hard to get along with."
Marisa,"And then, one day, Alice's favourite doll, Shanghai Doll, also started moving independently!"
Marisa,"Alice has yet to notice, but how long can they continue to hide this?"
Shanghai,Hya!
Hourai,What... is this all you got?
Shanghai,P-please wait a minute!
Hourai,During real battle...
Hourai,There is no waiting!!!
Shanghai,HYAAAAA!!?
Shanghai,Why are you doing this?
Hourai,I'm testing to see if you're a doll fit to protect Alice!
Hourai,Be grateful!
Hourai,Found a good reason.
Shanghai,I'm not grateful at all!!
Alice,Hm?
Alice,Was there a sound just now?
Marisa,R-really?
Marisa,I didn't hear anything...
Alice,Really...?
Alice,"Anyway, I see her writing is as skillful as always."
Marisa,Right?
Marisa,And I heard she has never gone to temple school before.
Alice,"So, I still can't meet her yet?"
Marisa,Uhh... because of family problems I guess... please understand.
Alice,Fufu...
Alice,I can't wait for the day we meet
Alice,"I'm going to write back, so read a book, okay?"
Marisa,I've pretty much read everything here...
Alice,The how about you do a little cleaning?
Marisa,Eh...
Marisa,I'd rather just take a nap.
Hourai,Just give it up already!
Shanghai,I recently gained consciousness and it's already time for me to give it up?
Hourai,"If you don't want that, then fight back"
Shanghai,Please don't ask the impossible
Hourai,"Damn, you're nimble!"
Hourai,But this is the end for you!
Hourai,Die!
Shanghai,Eeh?
Shanghai,Die??
Shanghai,What's with the effect?
Shanghai,I don't want to die!!
Hourai,I see...
Hourai,So that's your ability?
Shanghai,Will you approve of me now?
Hourai,That ability is certainly specialized in defense.
Shanghai,Then...
Hourai,"But, how will that defeat the enemy?"
Hourai,"If you don't defeat them, no matter how long you stand there, the attacks won't stop coming."
Shanghai,Uuu...
Marisa,Then just work together.
Marisa,Right?
Hourai,This has nothing to do with you.
Marisa,"Don't bully Shanghai so much, Hourai."
Marisa,"That's not very mature, you know?"
Hourai,I was just testing her!
Hourai,She can't protect Alice like this!!
Marisa,Don't be so impatient.
Hourai,I'm not impatient!
Marisa,"Anyway, here, you got a reply."
Marisa,"Make sure you're not found out while reading it, okay?"
Hourai,Eh? Y-yeah...
Marisa,Then this is where I take my leave!
Marisa,"Get along, you two!"
Shanghai,"Yes, Marisa!"
Marisa,"Also, Hourai, come here for a bit."
Hourai,What?
Marisa,She doesn't want to ruin the dress you made after all that effort.
Marisa,So try to sympathize with her.
Marisa,See ya!
Hourai,...
Shanghai,Big sis?
Hourai,Ah..
Hourai,Well....
Hourai,Umm..
Hourai,I went overboard...
Shanghai,Huh?
Shanghai,Who could that be?
Alice,Who is it?
Alice,Marisa?
Alice,Did you forget something?
Alice,SHANGHAI!
Alice,HOURAI!
Alice,What is it?
Alice,What do you want?
Yuuka,I'm the one who should be asking 'what'
Yuuka,Isn't this a bit too much?
Alice,What do you want?
Yuuka,"Nothing, I just came to pay a visit."
Yuuka,This isn't very nice of you...
Alice,To... visit?
Yuuka,See?
Yuuka,I even bought some snacks from the human village.
Yuuka,How about we have this with some tea?
Alice,...
Yuuka,You don't have to be so on alert...
Yuuka,I won't do anything.
Alice,Fine... come in.
Yuuka,Yaay <3
Yuuka,"You live alone, yet this is a pretty big house."
Alice,I'm not alone.
Yuuka,I see.
Yuuka,"But dolls don't really have emotions, right?"
Yuuka,That's where flowers are better.
Yuuka,They show many sides of themselves.
Alice,But an autonomous doll does exist.
Yuuka,Huh?
Alice,I saw one before...
Hourai,D-don't worry!
Hourai,It doesn't seem it's about us...
Hourai,I think!
Alice,"I don't know how, why or who made it..."
Alice,"But one day, I'll..."
Alice,HEY!
Alice,What are you doing !?
Yuuka,Huh?
Yuuka,"Well, I don't really get to see the inside of a magician's house..."
Yuuka,"So I'm exploring, exploring!"
Alice,What about tea?
Yuuka,Make~ it~ later~!
Alice,HEY!
Alice,Wait!
Shanghai,Sis...
Hourai,Yeah ...
Hourai,Aside from us...
Hourai,There's another doll.
Hourai,Who can move independently.
Marisa,Here.
Marisa,Could you not make me steal anymore stuff?
Patchouli,I'm simply employing a specialist.
Patchouli,"Besides, it is way too late for you to act like a good girls now."
Patchouli,You're not at all convincing.
Marisa,"So, what are you researching now?"
Marisa,Didn't you examine Shanghai and Hourai?
Patchouli,This girl has yet to move by itself...
Patchouli,So I have to investigate any and all possibilities.
Marisa,Is that so?
Marisa,But to think Alice's main objective is right in front of her eyes!
Patchouli,"As things are right now, I wouldn't say that she has reached her goal though..."
Marisa,"But it could become a hint for her, right?"
Marisa,"After all, magicians use anything they can to obtain knowledge."
Patchouli,Those words also befit you really well.... Miss little thief.
Marisa,Don't praise me!
Marisa,I'll blush!
Patchouli,"But ultimately, to tirelessly inquire, is what makes magicians, magicians."
Alice,"Hey, you invited me and said let's have tea..."
Alice,So how did it turn into this?
Yuuka,"You also need to get a little sun dried once in a while, not just your dolls."
Alice,That's not a good reason.
Alice,"First, you'll have to explain starting from the moment you forgot about having tea."
Alice,"Second, I'm not that seclusive."
Alice,"Third, explain why we are walking when..."
Yuuka,Magicians sure like to argue...
Yuuka,"Look, while you were saying all that, we made it."
Alice,Ha?
Yuuka,To the Field of the sun
Alice,The flowers are all facing this way...
Alice,Did you use your ability?
Yuuka,"That's right, today is special"
Yuuka,I have three guests here after all!
Alice,Better not do that to me...
Alice,"This pretty scene is nice and all, but isn't there any tree shade?"
Alice,My feet are numb.
Yuuka,That's what a hike is a ll about.
Shanghai,"Sister, is that person a bad person?"
Hourai,Dunno...
Hourai,"But if anything happens, we have to protect Alice."
Shanghai,That's right!
Hourai,Get down!
Shanghai,Hyah!?
Hourai,It's gone?
Shanghai,W-what's wrong?
Hourai,No... it's nothing.
Alice,This place sure is full of sunflowers.
Alice,Are you always here during the summer?
Yuuka,Of course.
Yuuka,"During the Fall, with the Fall flowers."
Yuuka,"And during winter, with the winter flowers."
Alice,I'd be happy if other youkai also had such peaceful ideas like that.
Yuuka,"By the way, doesn't this tea taste a bit strange?"
Alice,"Oh, that's the black tea Marisa made with mushrooms."
Yuuka,Black tea... mushrooms??
Alice,"Apparently, it's good for your health."
Alice,I've never drank it though.
Yuuka,"Eh... it's safe to drink this, right?"
Alice,I don't know.
Yuuka,HEY!
Yuuka,"That was given to you, so you drink it!"
Alice,No way I'll drink that suspicious stuff!
Yuuka,"Hey, wait a minute!"
Marisa,ACHOO!
Patchouli,Summer cold?
Marisa,"Nah, I'm sure Alice is talking about me."
Marisa,Saying how super delicious my black tea with mushrooms is!
Patchouli,I see.
Marisa,that's it?
Marisa,Have a bit more interest in it!
Marisa,'What's black tea with mushrooms?' something like that!
Patchouli,It raises no interest whatsoever.
Marisa,That bluntly?
Alice,"It's about time to go home, it's going to get dark soon."
Yuuka,I didn't think you'd read a book even after coming all this way...
Alice,"I can't help it, it's a daily routine."
Alice,"Oh yeah, about that autonomous doll I mentioned before."
Alice,I saw it at the Nameless Hill.
Alice,"It's close to here, right?"
Alice,Have you ever seen it Yuuka?
Yuuka,"Hmm, there are plenty of youkai, but I have no recollection of an autonomous doll."
Alice,I see...
Yuuka,Then can I ask something too?
Alice,What is it?
Yuuka,Has there been any strange things happening around you?
Yuuka,"Like restless animals, or plants strangely growing too fast?"
Alice,I don't know...
Alice,There aren't many animals in the Forest of Magic.
Alice,And it has always been a treasure cove of giant mushrooms...
Yuuka,"I used bad examples, I see..."
Yuuka,"Well, neve rmind, don't worry about it."
Alice,"If it's a fight between youkai don't get me involved, okay?"
Yuuka,"Yeah, okay."
Alice,"Well, thanks for today!"
Alice,It was better than I thought.
Yuuka,Are we now considered friends?
Hourai,What did she...?
Alice,"Sorry, but I have to refuse."
Yuuka,But of course.
Alice,"Okay, until next time."
Yuuka,Yes.
Yuuka,"How was it, Medi?"
Yuuka,"Those two dolls were moving by themselves, right?"
Medicine,Yeah... but...
Medicine,That girl in red... something was odd about her...
Yuuka,Really?
Yuuka,It appears we need to investigate a bit more...
Hourai,"And, here we go!"
Shanghai,"Ah, you're going to read your letter?"
Hourai,!!!
Hourai,Don't look!
Shanghai,Why not~?
Shanghai,Please let me see~!
Hourai,No way!!!
Hourai,This is between Alice and I... a secret between friends!
Shanghai,Muu...
Hourai,That's too bad...
Shanghai,Big Sis?
Shanghai,What's wrong?
Hourai,It's her...
Shanghai,Huh?
Hourai,The other doll which can move by itself!
Shanghai,Sis...
Hourai,Yeah...
Hourai,"She's different from us, and also more dangerous."
Hourai,Where is she looking?
Hourai,"Shanghai, hurry!"
Hourai,To the front door!
Alice,Ah...
Alice,You are...
Medicine,Nuisance.
Medicine,!!!
Medicine,Blue one...
Medicine,Red one!!
Medicine,Strong!!
Hourai,Final blow!!
Alice,Stop right there!!
Hourai,A... Alice?
Alice,"I'm sorry, it seems the automatic defense system was activated."
Alice,"You are an autonomous doll, aren't you?"
Shanghai,...
Hourai,Alice!
Alice,Please don't be so alarmed.
Alice,I'll put down the weapons.
Hourai,"What are you saying, Alice?"
Hourai,She tried to kill you...
Alice,"Hurry, put them down, Hourai."
Alice,This is an order.
Hourai,But Alice!!
Alice,Strange... did I make a mistake in the automatic defense system?
Medicine,"Hey, Hourai."
Alice,What would you do if you were to hurt this child even more than this?
Hourai,A... Alice...
Alice,"Hey, my name is alice."
Alice,What's yours?
Medicine,Medicine.
Hourai,"Alice, why?"
Alice,Medicine? What a cute name!
Hourai,What's so good about her?
Hourai,I'm way stronger than she is...
Alice,"Hey, Medi."
Alice,I've always searched for a girl like you!
Hourai,I made Shanghai's clothes for you!
Hourai,I learned to write just to write you letters!
Hourai,"I still can't write properly, but I'll practice more and more and more so..."
Medicine,Like me?
Alice,"Hey, Medi, want to come into my house?"
Alice,I'm sure I'll be able to fix this arm of yours.
Hourai,Didn't you make friends with me because of who I am?
Alice,"Also, I have many things to ask you."
Alice,Like why you attacked me.
Hourai,Are you  saying I'm the same as someone like her???
Alice,"So please, Medi..."
Hourai,"No, Alice!!!"
Hourai,Don't say it!!
Alice,Let's be friends.
Marisa,"To tirelessly inquire is what makes magicians, magicians."
Marisa,Was it?
Alice,"Mommy, mommy, look!"
Alice,"This time, I made these clothes!"
Shinki,"Oh my, those are some cute clothes!"
Shinki,That's great Alice.
Alice,Ehehe~!
Alice,"This time, you see, I tried working hard even on parts you can't see!"
Alice,The frills inside the skirt look great!
Alice,Look!
Shinki,"Alice, it's fine to play with you dolls."
Shinki,But won't you try to play with other children?
Shinki,Yuki and Mai...
Alice,No.
Shinki,N-no?
Shinki,That straightforward?
Alice,"Also, I made a promise."
Shinki,Promise?
Alice,"It's still impossible for me right now, but one day..."
Marisa,Right?
Marisa,Hourai?
Alice,Uhh...
Alice,Unn...
Alice,Ow!!
Marisa,Don't overexert yourself.
Marisa,It's not often I see you with grave injuries.
Alice,Marisa?
Marisa,Yo!
Marisa,"It was hard carrying you here, you know?"
Marisa,"We were both drenched, see..."
Marisa,So. What happened?
Marisa,"Normally, you wouldn't fight until you become like that, right?"
Marisa,And even during that downpour...
Alice,...
Marisa,"Well, if you don't wanna talk, that's fine."
Marisa,But don't try to move needlessly.
Marisa,"Unlike you, I'm a bit more clumsy."
Marisa,The bandages may come off.
Marisa,"Well then, see you later."
Marisa,"Man, that's some considerable damage she took..."
Shanghai,Marisa!
Shanghai,How's Alice?
Marisa,"Physically, she's fine."
Marisa,"What I'm talking about, is mentally."
Marisa,"What happened, Shanghai?"
Alice,Kya!!
Medicine,Alice.
Medicine,You and I cannot be friends.
Alice,W-why?
Alice,I won't hurt you!
Alice,Believe me!!
Medicine,"Asking one-sidedly, can that be called 'friendship'?"
Medicine,Yuuka!!
Yuuka,"I've come to pick you up, Medi."
Medicine,But these girls...
Yuuka,"There's no need to forcibly take them with us, let's do it next time."
Alice,Wha- What are you talking about?
Alice,"Do you know her, Yuuka?"
Alice,Didn't you say so before?
Alice,That you didn't know any autonomous doll?
Yuuka,I wasn't lying.
Yuuka,This girl is a doll who became a youkai after being thrown out by humans.
Yuuka,She's not a doll which was made to be autonomous.
Hourai,A.. Youkai?
Yuuka,That's how it is.
Yuuka,"Medi, let's go."
Alice,Wait!
Yuuka,Still have something to say?
Alice,It's okay...
Alice,That's right...
Alice,It's fine if she's a youkai...
Alice,Medi?
Alice,Isn't your arm still broken?
Alice,"And your clothes are drenched and muddy, right?"
Alice,I'll fix you right up... ok?
Alice,"Come, let's go into my house!"
Yuuka,Hey...
Alice,Yuuka shut up!!!
Alice,The person who threw you away is the worst right?
Alice,"You're so cute, and yet..."
Alice,"But, I will take care of you..."
Alice,I can also make new clothes for you....
Alice,"What's more, you'll have plenty of doll friends-"
Hourai,Stop it...
Hourai,Stop...
Hourai,"It's enough, Alice..."
Alice,Hourai?
Shanghai,Sis...
Hourai,"You're acting strange Alice, what happened?"
Hourai,This kind of Alice is-...
Alice,How are you doing this?
Yuuka,What do you mean?
Alice,"Well, she's the one..."
Alice,"Who's controlling Hourai, right?"
Alice,There's no way Hourai could talk.
Alice,No...
Alice,"Even if she could somehow speak temporarily, she would never say these things."
Alice,That's because Hourai is...
Alice,She's my...
Yuuka,You're unbelievable!
Yuuka,You don't understand a single thing do you?
Alice,Ku!
Alice,Isn't this too sudden?
Alice,Come!!
Alice,Shanghai! Hourai!
Alice,Wha-?
Alice,Hourai!!
Alice,You should cool your head down a bit Alice.
Yuuka,Fuu.
Yuuka,"So, let's go, Medi."
Medicine,Yeah.
Yuuka,"Ah, one more thing."
Shanghai,Sis!!
Shanghai,Alice isn't-!!
Hourai,Shanghai...
Hourai,Call Marisa...
Marisa,I see... that was terrible.
Shanghai,"But aside from me, my sister..."
Marisa,"Oh yeah, where is she?"
Shanghai,I saw her in the garden a while back.
Marisa,She's not here.
Shanghai,Sis!!
Cirno,Wagya!
Marisa,Cirno!?
Cirno,Ma-marisa?
Marisa,"What's wrong, what are you doing here?"
Cirno,"Someway, somehow..."
Cirno,"When we were playing hide and seek, it started moving!"
Marisa,Huh?
Marisa,What started to move?
Cirno,Well...
Shanghai,"Ma... Marisa, over there!"
Marisa,Huh?
Marisa,Ahavaaa
Marisa,Patchouli!!
Patchouli,You're so noisy.
Patchouli,"What do you need, Marisa?"
Marisa,Things have gotten out of hand!
Marisa,Come with me!!
Patchouli,Out of hand?
Patchouli,Give me a bit more of an explanation...
Patchouli,"It's about the Forest of magic, huh?"
Patchouli,Remi.
Remilia,"She's right, seems things are turning bad."
Marisa,You know?
Patchouli,What do you mean?
Remilia,A strange clump of magic is moving from the Forest of Magic.
Remilia,"And along it's path, it seems plants and animals have started acting strangely."
Hourai,Zhee
Marisa,Hourai?
Patchouli,Hourai?
Patchouli,What happened to her?
Marisa,No time to explain right now.
Marisa,Remilia!
Marisa,Do you know where she's heading?
Remilia,How could I know?
Remilia,Didn't you already examine her?
Marisa,I see...
Marisa,Thanks!
Patchouli,Remi...
Patchouli,What's going on?
Remilia,"That's what I want to know too, but..."
Remilia,Seems that Mana Belt is something my powers can't affect.
Patchouli,Then you mean...
Remilia,Yeah...
Remilia,This is something greater than we thought.
Alice,What do you mean the bandages might come undone?
Alice,"They're so tight, it's hard to move!"
Alice,"Shanghai, bring me my cape."
Shanghai,Shanghai.
Alice,"Hourai, my ribbo-..."
Hourai,Stop this already.
Alice,Oh... right...
Alice,"Hourai, was that really you?"
Alice,I was rejected by Medi.
Alice,And reprimanded by Yuuka.
Alice,"And you too, Hourai..."
Alice,"But, I couldn't help it..."
Alice,I've always been searching for it!
Alice,Always always always!
Alice,Just  when I thought it was withing my grasp...
Alice,Why?
Shanghai,Alice.
Shanghai,Calm down and listen to me.
Alice,Shanghai... ?
Shanghai,There's one thing I want you to tell me.
Shanghai,Do you resent her?
Alice,There's no way that I do!
Shanghai,Then let's talk.
Shanghai,"About Shanghai, Hourai and Alice's precious friends..."
Yuuka,Fuu~
Yuuka,Drinking tea under the blue sky is the best!
Yuuka,Though I feel bad for a certain vampire.
Medicine,Yuuka.
Medicine,Was it alright to leave those girls alone?
Yuuka,It's fine.
Yuuka,"Though, it seems like this is the end of our tea time."
Hourai,Yuuka!!!
Yuuka,"Oh my, you've advanced further than I thought."
Yuuka,You look just like a human.
Hourai,You'll tell me the truth... right?
Yuuka,Come visit me...
Yuuka,If you're interested in knowing what you are.
Hourai,What am I?
Hourai,Am I a youkai too?
Yuuka,Calm down.
Yuuka,It's not that I'm certain of this.
Hourai,That's not what you told me!
Yuuka,Be patient for a bit longer.
Yuuka,"That is, until all the players have assembled..."
Hourai,Players?
Marisa,Hourai!!
Hourai,Mari-sa...
Marisa,Well this is... I'm surprised
Marisa,You got so tall
Hourai,What do you want from me.
Marisa,Return to Alice's side.
Marisa,She's pretty sad you know?
Hourai,That's a lie.
Hourai,"It doesn't matter, if she loses one doll."
Hourai,"Rather, isn't she really happy right now?"
Hourai,She's found a lead to her dream of a self-moving doll after all!
Marisa,You...
Hourai,"I came to understand, that Alice only calls someone her friend when it's convenient for her!"
Marisa,Don't stop me Yuuka!
Yuuka,No.
Yuuka,You're not the one who is supposed to fight her.
Alice,Hourai!!!
Hourai,Alice!?
Alice,Shanghai said... you'll definitely be here.
Shanghai,Sis!
Alice,She told me everything...
Alice,"About her clothes, and the letters..."
Hourai,I don't care...
Alice,I'm sorry!
Hourai,Stop it...
Alice,"Please, come back, Hourai!"
Hourai,I said stop it!!
Hourai,I don't need friends anymore!!
Hourai,I won't believe your insincere words!
Shanghai,"You're wrong, sis!"
Hourai,Shut up!
Hourai,Alice... I hate you!
Alice,I though of doing anything to create an autonomous doll...
Alice,That was... for our promise...
Hourai,Promise?
Alice,But that was wrong.
Alice,I realized I've lost many things and my words didn't even reach you.
Alice,That's why I'll convey my feelings to you my own way!
Alice,So we can go home together!
Alice,You may say it's selfish...
Hourai,Alice.
Hourai,"You said so yourself, words won't reach me."
Hourai,Then show me.
Hourai,I'll beat them down and we'll forever part ways!
Alice,"Let's go, Hourai!"
Hourai,"Come, Alice!"
Marisa,"Alice, Hourai!"
Marisa,Damn!
Marisa,Why did it turn into this!
Yuuka,Isn't it rude to jump into the middle of a battle?
Marisa,Don't screw around!
Marisa,Alice is heavily injured!
Yuuka,"She brought this upon herself, right?"
Marisa,What are you planning?
Yuuka,Who knows?
Yuuka,"If you want to ask, you know what to do, right?"
Marisa,"Fine, then just as you wish, I'll make you tell me after your face is all beaten!"
Hourai,"You haven't improved, Shanghai."
Hourai,Uaah!!!
Hourai,Alice!!
Hourai,God dammit!
Alice,"That's not all you have, right?"
Hourai,Hmph...
Hourai,"Of course, this is just the beginning!!"
Yuuka,What's up with this danmaku?
Yuuka,They're just like rain drops!!
Yuuka,"It's fine to use the stronger ones, you know?"
Marisa,Tsk!
Marisa,Then how about this?
Yuuka,'Earth Light Ray'
Yuuka,"No good from the front, so you attack from the back?"
Yuuka,Isn't this too simple minded?
Yuuka,"Now it's my turn, be sure to dodge properly."
Yuuka,Hmph...
Yuuka,"What kind of magic was that, I wonder?"
Marisa,"What, just a simple magic trick."
Yuuka,I see...
Yuuka,"'Illusion Star', a simple illusion."
Yuuka,I was completely fooled.
Marisa,"Hey, it's already this far into the game, but do you think physical attacks can be in a danmaku battle?"
Yuuka,"Yeah, but well..."
Yuuka,They are not elegant.
Marisa,Really?
Yuuka,Is this a smoke screen?
Marisa,Alice!!
Yuuka,Tsk!
Yuuka,Wait!!
Marisa,Psyche!!
Marisa,You said physical attacks were fine... right?
Alice,Hourai.
Alice,"You're holding back, aren't you?"
Hourai,I'm not!
Alice,All her attacks barely miss me...
Alice,Hourai!
Alice,Then this will be the end...
Alice,Shanghai.
Shanghai,Yes.
Alice,'Curse Sign: Shanghai Doll'!
Hourai,'Malediction: Hourai Doll'!
Alice,A spell card?
Hourai,What...
Hourai,What was that?
Hourai,Alice!!
Hourai,T-this is...
Shanghai,"Alice, she was crying as she held that."
Hourai,Shanghai...
Shanghai,She said she couldn't hand that over to you anymore.
Shanghai,That she was sorry for hurting you...
Hourai,How stupid...
Hourai,I can no longer wear something this small?
Alice,"Then, we can just remake them however many times as we need."
Alice,Just like how you made Shanghai's clothes.
Alice,"Please, come back Hourai."
Hourai,Ali-
Yuuka,It's not over yet.
Patchouli,Just now...
Remilia,You felt it too Patche?
Patchouli,"So we were outwitted, huh?"
Remilia,Hm? are you going?
Patchouli,Yes.
Patchouli,"One would feel mortified being tricked like that, right?"
Marisa,Hou... rai!!
Yuuka,"Before, I was talking about what you really were."
Yuuka,That spellcard you activated gave me the clarification I needed.
Yuuka,Seems everyone has forgotten.
Yuuka,No.
Yuuka,"It's better to say, it was removed from everyone's memory."
Yuuka,So you still haven't realized.
Yuuka,"Can't even remember, that thing you always held so close to you?"
Alice,No way...
Yuuka,That's why I couldn't find you even if I searched Alice's whole house!
Yuuka,This is where you were!
Yuuka,Grimoire!
Yuuka,Did I fail?
Marisa,"That was close, by a hair."
Marisa,But what's going on over there?
Marisa,does this means Hourai absorbed the Grimoire?
Yuuka,The other way around.
Yuuka,It's bette3r to say the Grimoire used Hourai to hide itself.
Yuuka,"Taking it's owner's ambition, it tried to give form to an autonomous doll and lost control."
Marisa,And it arbitrarily changed our memories?
Yuuka,That's how it is
Yuuka,"I tried to re-seal the Grimoire before it's seal became undone, but I failed."
Yuuka,And we have to do something about this over here too.
Marisa,Whaa?
Marisa,Well this-
Alice,Marisa.
Alice,I'll leave that to you.
Marisa,Alice?
Yuuka,Wait! You can't do anything alone!
Alice,I'm not alone.
Alice,"Also, Hourai is there."
Alice,"Hourai, I'll surely stop you!"
Alice,Come! Hourai!
Alice,"Are you okay, Shanghai?"
Shanghai,"Y-yes, somehow!"
Alice,"Such fire power, but, I got her!"
Alice,Concentrate!
Alice,'Trip wire'!
Alice,Yes! Just like that and-
Alice,"No way, with strength alone?"
Alice,"Just now, her movements were sluggish..."
Alice,Listen to me Hourai.
Alice,You're a strong girl.
Alice,You won't even lose to the Grimoire!
Alice,Overcome it.
Alice,You're coming home with me!
Alice,'War Command: Dolls War'!
Marisa,"Woah, what's going on?"
Marisa,This is the first time I've seen Alice like this.
Yuuka,"Perhaps, that girl has finally realized what it means to be serious in something."
Marisa,What do you mean?
Yuuka,"You already know, don't you?"
Yuuka,"That's why she came here today, right?"
Marisa,Quit beating around the bush and tell me!
Yuuka,"For someone she can become so serious other than herself, and that is for a friend."
Alice,Hey hey listen!
Alice,I've decided!
Alice,"You are Hourai, Hourai!"
Alice,You will be my friend from now on!
Alice,Best regards!
Alice,"No good, huh?"
Alice,"You know, everyone treats me nicely."
Alice,They say I'm special.
Alice,But!
Alice,"Studying, talking and playing together that is arbitrarily given to me."
Alice,There isn't anyone who will see eye to eye with me.
Alice,N one to give me the same feelings as I give.
Alice,That's why...
Alice,I'll show you I can make it come true!
Alice,I'll give you... a heart!
Hourai,"Alice, stand back!"
Alice,Hourai?
Alice,What are you saying!
Alice,You're in a worse state than I am!
Alice,This is because of my selfish wish!
Hourai,"You're wrong, Alice."
Hourai,"When the Grimoire went inside me, I understood."
Hourai,What the Grimoire gave form to wasn't Alice's wish.
Hourai,It was my wish!
Alice,Hou... rai.
Hourai,Sorry...
Hourai,Sorry that I said I hated you...
Hourai,I love you!
Alice,I also love you too Hourai!
